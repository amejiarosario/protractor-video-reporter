# protractor-video-reporter

This is a fork of https://github.com/tepez/protractor-video-reporter to support video capture on a MAC and other enhancements like automatically naming individual test case video filenames.

A Jasmine 2 reporter that captures a screencast of Protractor specs running on a headless browser, e.g. under Xvfb.
This is especially usefull for debugging you e2e specs on you CI server.
The reporter also creates a SRT subtitles file to for the video so you can see which spec you are currently viewing and whether it passed or failed.

# Install

    npm install --save-dev protractor-video-reporter

# Prerequisites

You have to start Xvfb before starting Protractor and set the `DISPLAY` enviroment variable.

If you're using Jenkins CI, you can use the [Xvfb plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xvfb+Plugin) to easily achive that.

# Usage

In the protractor configuration file:

    var VideoReporter = require('protractor-video-reporter');

    ...

    onPrepare: function() {
      ...
      jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new VideoReporter({
        baseDirectory: Path.join(__dirname, 'reports/videos/')
      }));
    }


# Options

* `baseDirectory` (string): The path to the directory where videos are stored. If not existing, it gets created. Required.

* `singleVideo` (bool): If `true`, will create a single video file for all the specs. Defaults to `true`.
The file will be saved to `baseDirectory/protractor-specs.mov`.
If `singleVideo` is false, the reporter will create a separate video file for every spec and place it at `baseDirectory/{some random UUID}.mov`.
If you prefer this option, you would have to look at the "Spec video is in: ..." messages that are printed to the console.

* `createSubtitles` (bool): If `true` and singleVideo is also true, will create a SRT subtitles file with the name details of the currently running spec. Defaults to `true`.
The file will be saves to `baseDirectory/protractor-specs.srt`.

* `saveSuccessVideos` (bool): If `true`, will save the videos of the succussfull specs, as well as the failed specs. This has no effect if `singleVideo` is `true` - we'll always capture all the specs then. Defaults to `false`.

* `ffmpegCmd` (string):  The command used to execute ffmpeg, e.g. `'/usr/bin/ffmpeg'`. Defaults to `'ffmpeg'`.

* `ffmpegArgs` (array): The argumetns passed to ffmpeg, not including the actual output file which will be appended. Defaults to:
